Papers about REITs from 2014.

Reits_1.pdf is about Reits as a strategic asset.  The conclusion is that reits and private real estate have the same expected return when adjusted for leverage.  However retis are strongly influenced by broader stock market and are highly correlated with it.  So in a standard MVO analysis, private real estate is preferred.

Reits_2.pdf examines the efficacy of active management for reit stocks.  The returns of every reit specialist mutual fund available on Bloomberg were analyzed.  The results were negative with low statistical significance on outperformance and low persistance.  The results were not different for domestic and international managers.

Reits_3.pdf is a study of reits as a tactical asset.  The paper examines price to book, dividend yield spread to SP500 dividend and dividend yield spread to treasuries.  The paper concludes that for extreme measurements (price to book > 2.75, price to book <2, dividend yield spread to treasury < 1, or dividend yield spread to treasury > 3), there is some predictive value over the ensuing 6 to 12 months.  Otherwise, these statistics carry limited information.
