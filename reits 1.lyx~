\begin_layout Title
Characteristics of the NAREIT Index Compared to Private Real Estate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ASRS strategic asset allocation and the real estate strategic plan provide
 guidance for the ASRS real estate program.
 Under these plans, ASRS has allocated eight percent of total assets to
 real estate.
 The plans permit, but do not require, investment in REITs as part of the
 real estate portfolio.
 ASRS currently holds less than $100 million of real estate program in publicly
 traded REITs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this paper is to consider whether REITs should play a larger
 or different role in our portfolio.
 We consider here the characteristics of the NAREIT index compared to private
 real estate and whether a passive implementation of REITs would be beneficial
 to the ASRS real estate program and total portfolio.
 In a subsequent writing we will consider active and tactical approaches
 to REITs.

The Indices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
REITs are corporations that own real estate and are organized under tax
 laws to enjoy tax exempt status.
 REITs can be public or private, but we confine our focus here to public
 REITs.

\begin_layout Standard
In order to compare REITs to private real estate, we are using two indices.
 The FTSE NAREIT all equity REIT total return index (FNERTR bbg ticker)
 is a market cap weighted index of total return for all equity REITs listed
 on the NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ exchanges.
 The NCREIF NPI total return index (NPPITR bbg ticker) is a market cap weighted
 appraisal based index of unlevered property returns of investment properties
 in tax exempt institutional ownership.
 The total market capitalization of REITs and the total value of properties
 included in NCREIF are shown in the graph in figure 1.
 Both indices reflect returns derived from traditional core real estate
 categories including office, apartments, retail, industrial and hotels.
 Additionally, REITs own specialty property types such as self storage and
 senior housing, while these categories are excluded form NCREIF.
 Both indices are widely used and regarded as representative of their asset
 category.
 A more detailed discussion of the properties of the indices is found in
 a 2003 article by Joe Gyourko

\begin_layout Section
Returns
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the following charts, we look at the comparative returns of NAREIT and
 NCREIF indices.
 REITs are typically levered at 1 to 1.5 to one, while NCREIF is an unlevered
 index.
 In order to make the returns more comparable and relevant to the ASRS real
 estate strategy which contemplates 1 to 1 (50%) leverage, we also provide
 a 1 to 1 levered NCREIF return.
 First, we present rolling one year and ten year returns in figure 2.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adjusted for leverage, the NCREIF and NAREIT returns are roughly comparable.
 We explore this further in the charts in figure 3.
 In these charts, we plot the difference between the one year rolling and
 10 year rolling NAREIT and levered NCREIF returns.
 We add a regression line to show the trend of the difference.
 In both cases, the regression line trends down.
 REITs had a period of strong outperformance during the 1990s.
 Both indices were much smaller in that time frame with the REIT index holding
 less than $6 billion in assets in 1990.
 It's possible that REITs outperformed during the 1990's because they were
 pursuing more productive parts of the market, but it's also possible that
 it is simply statistical anomaly.
 As both indices have become much larger, they appear to have converged.
 If you look at the later years of the 10 year rolling returns, the NAREIT
 returns are similar to the levered NCREIF and, by coincidence, nearly identical
 in the last 10 year period measured.

Volatility
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In figure 4, we present two-sigma confidence ellipses for the return and
 standard deviation for levered NCREIF and NAREIT for the the most recent
 10 and 20 years, ending September 30 for REITs and June 30 for NCREIF.
 These calculations are based on bootstrapping from those return series
 over the indicated time frame.
 While the analysis shows that any difference in returns is not statistically
 significant, the standard deviation for REITs is much higher.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NCREIF returns are less volatile due to appraisal smoothing.
 While there is doubt about the usefulness of measured volatility of NCREIF
 for portfolio construction purposes and we will discuss this below, the
 appraisal values and returns are required to be used in financial reporting
 for investors like ASRS.

As you can see in figure 5, NCREIF returns are significantly auto-correlated,
 while REIT figures are only slightly so.
 As a reference point, we also plot the autocorrelation of the S&P 500 to
 show it is not autocorrelated at all.

The existence of the autocorrelation is a strong indication of lags from

 A result of the appraisal lags is to significantly smooth the returns and
 understate their volatility.

 discussed a method for desmoothing returns which we illustrate here.
 This approach assumes that appraisals reflect a blending of information
 from prior valuations and current market trends such that:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R.observed_{t}=\alpha(R.observed_{t-1})+(1-\alpha)R.true_{t}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You then solve for the

 return as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R.true_{t}=(R.observed_{t}-\alpha(R.observed_{t-1}))/(1-\alpha)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This can be done with one lag term (as shown in the above formulas) or more.
 You then solve for smoothing parameters with a regression to find the best
 fit.
 With one lag term this is called an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

AR(1)
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 process.
 We have implemented an AR(2) process.
 The results of the desmoothed returns are shown in figure 6.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The desmoothed data look promising.
 They show more volatility and the drawdown of around 60% during the GFC
 is comparable to the drawdown in REITs in the same time frame.
 The volatility of the desmoothed returns is more than tripled with the
 desmoothing process.
 They are still somewhat autocorrelated, but not as bad.

\begin_layout Section
Correlation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Understanding the correlation of real estate with liquid assets is a conundrum
 and estimates vary widely.
 The researchers mentioned above have shown that with some statistical coaxing
 REITs and NCREIF respond to economic conditions similarly and, when adjusted
 for leverage, generate comparable returns.
 That makes sense because it is the exact same activity with a different
 legal wrapper.
 That's helpful, but we have more work to do to understand how real estate
 behaves in a portfolio with other assets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we check the correlation of daily REIT returns with S&P 500 returns over
 the last 5 years, we find that REITs are 83% correlated with large cap
 stocks.
 When you consider that the S&P 500 is nearly 50% in tech, pharma and financial
 firms which bear little resemblance to rental real estate, this is surprising.
 If we do the same calculation with monthly data since 1994, we still get
 a correlation of 58%.
 Clearly the stock market has a big influence on REIT valuation, especially
 in shorter time frames.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, if we check the levered NCREIF correlations using monthly
 data over the same time period, NCREIF is only 15% correlated with the
 stock market.
 This is surprisingly low.
 Notwithstanding big differences in the fundamental nature of the businesses,
 both share a connection to the economy and depressed aggregate demand will
 negatively impact either activity.
 Desmoothing appears to be of some help hear.
 In addition to increasing volatility to plausible levels the correlation
 to the stock is increased to 25%, which still feels low but is moving in
 the right direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In tables 1 and 2, we show the mean returns, standard deviation and correlation
 matrix for these series using monthly returns for 20 years ended June 30,

Efficient Portfolios
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will calculate efficient portfolios using the data in the return and
 correlation tables above.
 We are using a standard mean-variance optimization algorithm to find a
 minimum volatility portfolio with an expected return of 8% per year.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our first cut at these calculations, we will use the calculated values
 for the standard deviation and correlation matrix but will use the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

assumed returns
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 shown in table 1.
 We believe that the true underlying returns of real estate are the same
 whether owned in a public REIT or a private structure.
 Any difference in measured returns reflects market or statistical anomaly,
 not a fundamental property that should be incorporated in a portfolio modeling
 framework.
 Similarly, we set the return for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

desmoothed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 NCREIF equal to the other real estate categories.
 We believe 8% is a reasonable long term expected return for levered real
 estate.
 We set stock returns 100bp higher at 9%.
 We set bond returns at 5%.
 The last 20 years have seen falling rates which have increased bond returns.
 In a flat to rising rate environment, bond returns should be lower than
 what occurred in the past 20 years.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We present in figure 7 three efficient portfolios.
 Each of the portfolios selects among three assets.
 Stocks and bonds are included in all the portfolios.
 The third asset is one of the three real estate constructs -- NAREIT, levered
 NCREIF, or levered NCREIF desmoothed by the AR(2) process.
 The MVO model does not give any weight to NAREIT -- it is correlated with
 stocks, has higher volatility and lower returns.
 The model loves levered NCREIF and assigns nearly 100% of assets to this
 category -- it has very low volatiliy, low correlation and good returns.
 But we have doubts about the reliability of the NCREIF numbers for portfolio
 allocation purposes because the appraisal process causes volatility and
 correlations to be understated.
 Finally, we present a portfolio built using desmoothed NCREIF data reflecting
 higher volatility and higher correlation to the other assets.
 This portfolio allocates about 15% to bonds and splits the rest between
 stocks and real estate.
 Some real world portfolios might look like that, but the weight is still
 quite high and much higher than commercial real estate is represented as
 a proportion among all invest-able assets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a thought experiment, we decided to attempt to reverse engineer capital
 markets.
 If real estate is 10% to 20% of invest-able assets, what sort of parameters
 would be consistent in an MVO context for an allocation to real estate
 of around 20%.
 Fans of Black Litterman will recall that this sort of reverse engineering
 is at the heart of that approach.
 We experimented with increased volatility and found that as long as real
 estate was less volatile, the model tended to approximately split the non-bond
 assets between real estate.
 We experimented with correlation and found much the same outcome.
 It wasn't until we increased volatility to an amount equal to what is assumed
 for stocks and increased correlation to 50% (almost as high as REITs) that
 the model would reduce its allocation to real estate to around 20%.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
REITs and NCREIF are indices reflecting returns from ownership of real estate.
 When adjusted for leverage, there returns are statistically equivalent
 although one form of ownership may outperform the other for certain stretches
 of time.
 The most reasonable conclusion is that their expected returns are the same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
REITs are very volatile.
 They are much more volatile than private real estate and more volatile
 than the stock market.
 The volatility of private real estate is underestimated by the NCREIF data
 which is autocorrelated and suffers from smoothing as a result of the appraisal
 process.
 Statistical methods of desmoothing have been studied and are illustrated
 here.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

true
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 volatility is likely much higher than what is measured from NCREIF data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
REITs are highly correlated to the stock market, in the 80s on daily data
 and in the 50s on monthly data.
 NCREIF shows very low correlation to other assets, but this is likely understat
ed because of appraisal smoothing.
 Statistically desmoothed NCREIF series show increaed correlation to both
 stock and REITs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We calculated standard deviations and correlations for real estate as NAREIT,
 levered NCREIF and desmoothed levered NCREIF.
 Standard MVO models do not select NAREIT and grab large portions of unfiltered
 NCREIF.
 These results are moderated when using desmoothed NCREIF but the MVO still
 selects a large allocation to real estate.
 We found that if we (arbitrarily) assume that NCREIF volatility is equal
 to the stock market and 50% correlated with it, the portfolio allocation
 is reduced to around 20% which is roughly in line with the percentage of
 commercial real estate among all invest-able assets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
REITs are real estate and an acceptable way to gain exposure to real estate
 if you are indifferent to volatility and correlation to the stock market.
 They have the advantage of liquidity but are not expected to generate a
 higher return.
 REITs move with the stock market, especially in the short run and thus
 provide less diversification benefit than private real estate.
 While the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

true
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 volatility of private real estate is likely to be much higher than the
 reported volatility based on appraisals.
 However, appraisal basis valuation is used in financial reporting for investors
 like ASRS and some people regard that as a benefit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a future writing, we will discuss active management and tactical approaches
 with REITs.
