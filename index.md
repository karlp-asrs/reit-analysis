## Reit analysis

Here are three papers about reits from 2014.

Firt paper examines the return characteristics of reits.  The paper confirms the results of earlier research by Gyorko that, when adjusted for leverage, reit and private real estate returns are the same.  It also considers the effects of smoothing from appraisal measurements, possible desmoothing methodologies and efficient portfolio implications.

The second paper explores if active management adds value in reit portfolios.  It looks at the returns of all reit mutual available on Bloomberg and finds no evidence of active managment efficacy in domestic or international reits.

The third paper considers tactical signals for tactical timing of reit index investing.  It concludes, that except for extreme values, standard valuation metrics do not reliably signal near term returns.
